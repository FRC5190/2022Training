# Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
An IDE is the program you will be using to actually write your code. 
There are many different types of IDEs designed for different languages and developers.

## Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA
IntelliJ is a powerful IDE primarily designed for `Java` and `Kotlin`.
It is has lots of tools to help you program including integration with "Kotlin Koans," a series
of lessons and exercises you will complete later on.
The company behind Intellij, Jetbrains, also has IDEs for numerous other programming languages with the same
"look and feel," though excluding `PyCharm` for `Python` they are generally not as capable as Intellij is with 
`Java` and `Kotlin`.

## Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is an IDE that can be used for almost any language. 
It is extension based, relying on the community to develop plugins to make coding easier and to add support 
This means that it is very lightweight and good for scripting languages.
Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are different IDEs.

## Others
If you prefer another IDE like Eclipse, Netbeans, or no IDE (VIM, Emacs, other text editors) 
you will be able to write code for the robot and complete the training assignments, but you will be largely on your own 
for IDE specific issues. Most programmers on the team either use Jetbrains or Visual Studio Code.
